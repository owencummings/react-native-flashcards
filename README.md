# React Native & Redux Mobile Flashcards, an Udacity Project

A React Native app used to store flashcards and present quizes to the user. Uses Redux for state management.

The app is designed with iOS in mind, though the features and design are easily transferable to Android.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Simply fork the reposity and run 

```
npm install 
```

and then 

``` 
npm run 
```

It will require a native iOS device (real or emulated) to run on. Go to <https://expo.io/> if you wish to run it on your mobile device.


## What I learned

Bringing React-style declarative components to mobilea. This pattern of development allows developers to consolidate their resources and develop one app, not three at a time.


## What could be improved

Further iOS styling, Android functionality.
